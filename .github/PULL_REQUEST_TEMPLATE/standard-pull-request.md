# Read first

## We manage everything through issues, not PRs.

A PR is a **solution**. A solution without a **problem** breaks release notes. **Please open an issue** so the list of problems that were fixed can be correctly listed and be attributed to you.

If this is an unsolicited change, or there is no existing issue filed for it, **please open a GitHub issue before creating a pull request**. This will allow us to discuss the motivations and the big picture behind the change first. It's possible there may be other solutions that should be discussed for what you think should be built. It is possible your change will be rejected unless some discussion around your proposal happens first. While creating this PR means you probably already did the work, **it still makes sense to file an issue now**, and into the future when you have proposed changes.

Additionally, when attributing credit in releases, we use issues to determine who worked on each version. If there isn't an issue assigned to you, you may not get credit in release notes.

## Description

Once there is an issue filed, a PR can be linked to it.

Please include a summary of the change in the PR and which issue number is fixed, including relevant motivation and context. Mark this as a Draft or WIP and write up some details later and start a conversation, even if your PR is not ready for review or you haven't yet provided all the information.
